        <p>Sales of single-use, pre-filled plastic water bottles have increased almost every single year for more than a decade. In 2011, greater than US $11 billion was spent on bottled water products in the United States alone. In 2017, The US spent $11.5 billion on bottled waters. The International Bottled Water Association (IBWA) states that people are increasingly relying on water bottles for convenience and portability.

            In some countries with low-quality tap water, citizens also use bottled water (including in family-size containers kept in the home) for health reasons. For example, as of 2010, Mexico had an average 8 percent increase per year in bottled water purchases, and consumed approximately 13 percent of the world's total of bottled water. Mexican citizens drink more bottled water than those of any other country do, an average of 61.8 gallons per person each year â€“ more than twice the rate of US per capita consumption. The increase in the use of single-use personal plastic water bottles has contributed markedly to the country's litter problem, though the increase in the popularity of bottled water has come with a decrease in the growth rate of consumption of soft drinks (which pose health risks in excessive quantities, as well as the same littering problem).</p>
